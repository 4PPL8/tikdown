# Netlify Environment Variable Setup

## Important: Fix Environment Variable Name

There appears to be an issue with the environment variable name in your Netlify configuration. The correct environment variable name should be:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
```

However, it's currently set as:

```
ACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
```

## How to Fix

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site settings
3. Go to "Environment variables" section
4. Delete the incorrect variable `ACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`
5. Add a new environment variable with the correct name `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`
6. Set the value to `https://tikdown-backend.onrender.com`
7. Save the changes
8. Trigger a new deployment

## Verification

After making these changes, you should verify that:

1. The environment variable is correctly set in your Netlify dashboard
2. The build logs show that the correct environment variable is being used
3. The console logs in the browser show the correct API URL being used

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues after fixing the environment variable name, check:

1. That the backend server at `https://tikdown-backend.onrender.com` is running and accessible
2. That CORS is properly configured on the backend to allow requests from your Netlify domain
3. That the API endpoints are correctly implemented on the backend
